[0.2.0] - 2017/12/28
--------------------
    -   Cosmological values now include: redshift, scale-factor, distance (luminosity & comoving), time (universe-age & lookback).
        -   This uses the `cosmopy` python package as a backend.
    -   Each parameter can be entered to retrieve all of the other parameters.
    -   Plot of cosmological parameters vs. redshift has been added.


[0.1.0] - 2017/12/23
--------------------
    -   The program uses Electron for the frontend with a minimal python backend to run the cosmological calculation.
    -   Currently a redshift can be entered and a luminosity distance will be calculated and returned in response.
